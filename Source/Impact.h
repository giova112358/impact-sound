    Basic solid impact interaction algorithm. The interaction is
    represented by the structure resonator-interactor-resonator
    object models expose two pickup points, for the resonating object,
    and one pickup point for the exciter. Each pickup point gives information
    about displacement and velocity, and can as well be used to apply
    an external force to the resonator.
